The following CSS code demonstrates a solution using `rem` units to avoid the issues related to the dynamic nature of `em` units within `calc()`:

```css
:root {
  font-size: 16px; /* Set a baseline font size */
}

.container {
  width: calc(50% - 1rem);
}
```

Using `rem` units ensures that the width adjustment (1rem in this case) remains consistent regardless of changes in parent font sizes.  The root element's font size serves as a fixed reference point.  This approach improves the predictability and consistency of the layout.
